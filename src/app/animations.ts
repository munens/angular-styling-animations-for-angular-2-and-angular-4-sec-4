import { trigger, style, state, transition, animate } from '@angular/animations';

// The trigger defines which set of animations can be played, set of animations will contain various states for which you can switch. 
// Trigger determines the current state. 
// Trigger takes 2 arguments i). the name of the trigger made by you, ii). array of animation metadata - allows you to define states with respective styles and transitions between them.
// State 
export const clickedStateTrigger = trigger('clickedState', [
	// state takes 2 arguments: i). the name of the state, ii). the styles to apply to the state
	state('default', style({
		backgroundColor: 'orange',
		width: '100px',
		height: '100px'
	})),
	state('clicked', style({
		backgroundColor: 'blue',
		width: '300px',
		height: '50px'
	})),

	// If this state here is referenced from the same div that other states are called from it is important that properties from prev. states are maintained. 
	// i.e. If the height and width below did not exist and we wanted to apply it before/after one of the other states were referenced, this state below would 
	//      be called without the height and width properties that existed in prev. states.
	state('mousedown', style({
		backgroundColor: 'red',
		border: '1px solid black',
		height: '100px',
		width: '100px'
	})),

	// a trigger has multiple states and each state has a style or array of styles.

	// how to transition between states: - use the transition module:
	//  i). 1st argument describes when this transition should be applied: multiple transitions maybe applied for different states.
	// ii). 2nd argument what should happen once the animation is fired.
	//      - 1st argument of animate method takes 3 arguments in one string: i). duration, ii). initial delay and iii). timing function.
	//      - 2nd argument (optional) defines the styling after our animation is done.
	transition('default => clicked', animate('1s 500ms ease-in')),

	// we can use more than one transition statement that allows us to perform multiple transitions:
	// - using just an integer as an argument refers to 300ms duration, 0 delay and a linear timing function. Can also simply pass a string '300ms'.
	transition('clicked => default', animate(300)),

	//transition('mousedown => clicked', animate(300)),
	//transition('clicked => mousedown', animate(300)),

	// ^ is the same as:
	transition('mousedown <=> default', animate(300))

		// we can add yet more steps after the animation above happens: - now the animation will transition into the following styling:
		// angular does not track the last state we had and therefore border and padding wont appear in this next transition. Therefore for every subsequent
		// style (i.e. apart from the first) that we have we have to sandwich it inside animates.
		// if we wanted the style here below to keep track of the prev. style we can make it a second argument of the prev.animate function instead. 
		// - This will also make the animation smoother as the border and padding properties in the prev. state wont be lost before the background property 
		//   is then added.
